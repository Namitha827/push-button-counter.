**This project involves the development of a simple and interactive temperature monitoring system using an Arduino Uno, a TMP36 analog temperature sensor, a 16x2 LCD display, and a push button for user-controlled temperature display. The core objective of this system is to provide real-time temperature readings only when requested by the user, which helps reduce unnecessary screen updates and power consumption. The TMP36 temperature sensor, known for its accuracy and ease of use, is responsible for continuously sensing the surrounding temperature and outputting an analog voltage corresponding to the temperature in degrees Celsius. This analog signal is fed into one of the Arduino’s analog input pins (A0), where it is converted into a temperature value through appropriate voltage-to-temperature conversion logic. The user interface is managed through a 16x2 LCD screen, which displays the temperature in degrees Celsius only when the push button is pressed. When the button is not pressed, the display remains in a standby state with a message prompting the user to press the button, such as “Press button.” This functionality is achieved using a digital input pin configured with an internal pull-up resistor, allowing the button to operate reliably without requiring any external resistor. The LCD operates in 4-bit mode and is connected to six of the Arduino's digital pins (RS, E, D4-D7) along with power and ground. A 10kΩ potentiometer is used to control the contrast of the LCD for clear visibility under different lighting conditions. The entire system is powered through the Arduino board, which can be connected via USB or an external power source. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of analog sensor interfacing, digital input handling, and LCD communication using the Arduino platform. It is especially suitable for beginners in electronics and embedded systems, as it provides hands-on experience with components like sensors, displays, and user input devices. The project is also highly scalable, allowing future enhancements such as displaying the temperature in Fahrenheit, adding real-time clock modules for timestamping, logging temperature data onto an SD card, or integrating a buzzer to provide alerts when the temperature crosses a specific threshold. Applications of this project can range from basic room temperature monitoring to integration into larger home automation or IoT systems. Overall, the temperature display system with push-button control is an effective and educational example of combining hardware components with embedded programming to solve real-world problems, making it ideal for educational demonstrations, mini-project submissions, or early-stage prototyping of environmental sensing devices.
